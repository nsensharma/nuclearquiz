	<div><h2>CORRECT!</h2>
	The coal used in a coal powered plant has carbon along with large quantities of sulfur and produces CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> etc. These gases are called <q>greenhouse gases</q> and lead to global warming and environmental pollution.
	Hydro plants are environment friendly which however is achieved at the cost of large areas of fertile land being submerged in water. These also create a lot of disturbance in the ecosystem of the surrounding area.
	Whereas the only small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced from the Nuclear fuel cycle is during the mining process. The land requirement and amount of waste produced is also minimal making Nuclear power plants the most environment friendly.
