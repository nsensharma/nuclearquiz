	<div><h2>CORRECT!</h2>
	India houses about 390,000 tons of thorium that can be mined. This is almost about 25% of the world thorium resources, most of which are available in the thorium-rich monazite sands of Kerala beaches. At the present consumption rate, this would be enough to serve the electricity needs of India for the next 500 years.
